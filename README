README 

my linker was written in c++, and on my tests passes 18/19 of the samples given (when I tried fixing the last, I screw up others so I gave up trying to fix it, but I know the problem has to do with multiple '\n' between last character and EOF).

compile cmd : g++ linker.cpp
run command : ./a.out
